    <h2>About me!</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Tanner Curry, and I am an apiring software engineer!
    I have experience in both barbering and software engineering, which has given me a unique perspective on customer service and problem-solving.
    I am passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills in programming languages such as</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Advanced Typescript</li>
        <li>Advanced C#</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I look forward to learning more about networking and AI in the near future to progress my understanding of the current state of the technology industry!
    My other identity lies in barbering! I've spent the last 5 years becoming more profecient in my craft and furthering my understanding of hair.
    Along with that, I've learned how to run a small business, manage customer relationships, and provide tailored haircuts.
    I hope to one day combine both of my passions to create innovative solutions for the beauty industry!
